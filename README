TheHighway's xbmc plugin repository!
-------------------------------

Install:
		You can manually install via System - Add-ons - Install from zip file... if you wish to manually download the zip from:
*				http://raw.github.com/HIGHWAY99/repository.thehighway/master/repo/repository.thehighway/repository.thehighway-0.0.6.zip
		Another means is via SuperRepo.org:
*				As shown @ https://superrepo.org/get-started/
*				Add Files source named "SuperRepo": http://srp.nu/
*				Then goto: System - Addons - Install from zip file - SuperRepo (the Files source you just made).
*				Select your type of xbmc/kodi installed such as "Helix".
*				Select "all".
*				Select "repository.superrepo.org.helix.all-latest.zip" to install SR's repository of user repositories among seemingly all other things.
*				Now back up to where you clicked "Install from zip file" and click "Get Add-ons".
*				Next click "SuperRepo  All [helix]" or simular.  Sometimes you'll have to right click this and hit force refresh a couple times or so until it populates a list.
*				Once it comes up with a list, click "Add-on repository", there should be a HUGE list of repositories here.
*				Scroll way down or up to get to the bottom and up a bit more until you find the T's, then select "TheHighway's Addons" and include Install on the next screen.
*				Once it's done downloading and installing, you man then go back to the "Get Add-ons" list and select TheHighway's Addons" (sometimes having to force refresh), and browse a list of addons by TheHighway for download.

*		Should have an irc channel up again soon.
