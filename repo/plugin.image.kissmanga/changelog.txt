- Check out Settings for a Genre and All|#|A-Z Style changer to change the graphics for the 2 folder listings.  At this moment it looked like some links with -'s were having problems so some icons for 'ALL' don't seem to want to show up.  Please go easy on switching between these as to not bombard the remote hosts.

- After a few seconds thought I did go ahead and add in an option in the Settings Window for having the old style method displayed as well.
