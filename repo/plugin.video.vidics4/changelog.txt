[B]Version 0.2.6[/B]
### Some url's now still have watch- and some have text after the -YEAR, so I've dealt with that as well.
- Due to changes in the site, I had to redo the parsing for Items.  Host parsing and playable link methods seem unchanged as far as I've tested.

[B]Version 0.2.5[/B]
- Searches and TV Series/Seasons/Episodes are currently dissabled still and need more work done on them.
- Parsing for Video Hosters has been fixed.
- Setup doSearchNormal() for vidics4, but pages aren't setup for the differances in parsing yet.
- listItems() - Slight fix to NextPage parsing string for the slight variation in some pages/categories.  This seems to keep the categories (which only happened with some) from getting stuck on the spin-cicle.

[B]Version 0.2.4[/B]
- Major problems with some pages of movie listings causing stalls has made me ponder rather to continue this project.
- Split TV Genres to a seperate list and have them hidden for now. (code is in Menu_BrowseByGenre for them, but page parsing not setup yet)
- Pagination.  (Setup of Next Page stuff)
- Browse List of Movies on pages. (Not all are working yet.)
- Category Menu.  Careful here, some menus will cause stalls.  (Testing done in XBMC-Gotham)
- Initial Main Menu Changes
- Initial Build (Forked from -my- solarmovie.so project)
