[B]Version 0.3.0[/B]
- After a few seconds thought I did go ahead and add in an option in the Settings Window for having the old style method displayed as well.
- Old items on the MainMenu Removed/Hidden for genre/sortmethod folder list instead of the new select list.  Let me know if there's any interest in putting those back in, with a setting option to display them or not.
- Favorites Folder No. 3 and 4 have been added.  Remember that you can customize their names in the Settings Menu.
- _DoGetItems(), Select_AZ(), Select_Sort(), Select_Genre() added for the new choice list(s) method.  You can now choose All, Numbers (0-9), or A-Z for the Anime List.
- MetaHandler import added to addon.xml as a requirement.

- Normal Search - .replace(' ','+') - Fix was more for KissManga than for KissAnime, but it still works on both.
- Favorites - Fixed mode to 'GetEpisodes' to make it work.

[B]Version 0.2.8[/B]
- Some Slight changes using additional settings in config.py to make things easier to update in both kissanime and kissmanga addons.

- Backdrop/Fanart, Cover/Thumbnail, and some other metadata information setup  to be used when the User ENABLES the option in the Addon/Plugin Settings under Metadata.

- Metahandler import(s) moved from default.py to teh_tools.py.
- Additional Changes Made for Anime Settings in Settings Window.
- Favorites Empty fixed in Settings Window.

- Changed made to the displaying of Episode Names.

[B]Version 0.2.7[/B]
- Project still needs a lot of code clean up and some more work, but I'm going to go ahead and release this version for people to use since it can now play videos, and has numerous features and categories to browse.
- Search - Feature added (Normal Search).
- listLinks() - The downloadable choices dont seem to wanna work reguardless of what I toss at it.  The contentURL finally works to play the videos.
- listEpisodes() - seems to be working so far.
- BrowseByAZ() - currently bugged.  By-passed for the time being, so no 0/A-Z... just All by default.
